This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a common error in handling null and NaN values within functions. The original code has a bug related to how it handles null values; however, this could lead to unexpected behaviour if other falsy values (e.g., 0, "", false) were also being handled incorrectly.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to handling these edge cases, enhancing the reliability of the function. The code is well-commented to facilitate understanding.
